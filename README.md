### Getting Started

Cmd/Ctrl+I: Make text _italic_. Works just like in Word.

Cmd/Ctrl+B: Make text **bold**. Also works just like in Word.

Cmd+Alt+R (macOS) Ctrl+Alt+F (Windows/Linux): Create a footnote.

Alt/Ctrl+Click (on a footnote reference): Edit a footnote. Hit Shift+Enter to finish editing.

Cmd/Ctrl+K: Insert a link. (Alt/Ctrl+Click it to open the link.)
Cmd/Ctrl+J: Enter the distraction-free mode.
Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+L: Toggle the theme between light and dark mode.

The Alt(ernative) key triggers alternative actions on the same element.
The Shift modifier key shifts the target of an action to another element (mostly the directory instead of the file).

All crucial actions are located in the toolbar. Left are general actions, middle are file-based actions, and to the right are other actions.

## Heading

> this is a quote
> > Quote in quote
> Outer quote again


# links
I can use two opening brackets \[\[ and two closing brackets \]\] to signify a link to another card in the deck.

Example:
Here is a link to a random notecard on rotation matrices that I have create.
